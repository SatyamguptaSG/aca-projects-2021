 This project "Learning RL to develop AI agents" is offered by ACA(Association of Computer Activities IITK).
 ## General Concepts :
 ### <u> Introduction to Machine Learning </u>
 Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.<br>
 A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,if its performance on T,as measured by P, improves with experience E.
 #### <ins>Machine learning algorithms:</ins>
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- ***Reinforcement learning.*** 

#### <ins>Model Representation</ins>
Generaling speaking,The aim of the supervised learning algorithm is to use the given training Dataset and output a ***Hypothesis function***.Where Hypothesis function takes the input instance and predicts the output based on its learnings from the training dataset.
